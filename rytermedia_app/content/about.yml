  Hi, I'm **Ethan Ryter**, a sports multimedia journalist and photographer based in Decatur, Georgia.

  I recently graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor's Degree in Sports Journalism from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism. I love soccer. I've played and watched soccer since I was three years old and have never looked back since.

  I started my Sports Journalism journey when I tore my ACL in 8th grade. I couldn't imagine life without sports so I asked to help my local High School soccer team. After picking up cones in practice I worked my way into writing articles and producing video content for three years, including a successful state championship run in 2016. A run where my articles created an excited fan base that slowly started to believe in the team's chances at winning it all.

  ### My Reporting Philosophy

  I believe that every athlete has a story worth telling, and my goal is to capture those stories in a way that resonates with audiences. Whether it's through dynamic photography, engaging videography, or compelling written narratives, I strive to bring the excitement and emotion of sports to life.
  ### What Drives Me

  My passion for sports journalism is fueled by the thrill of competition and the human stories behind the athletes. I am dedicated to showcasing the dedication, perseverance, and triumphs of athletes at all levels, from youth sports to professional leagues.
  ### Beyond the Screen

  When I'm not taking pictures of sports, I'm watching them! My first love was soccer, and I'm a die-hard Liverpool fan.
