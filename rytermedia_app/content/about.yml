  Hi, I'm **Ethan Ryter**, a sports multimedia journalist and photographer based in Decatur, Georgia.

  I recently graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor's Degree in Sports Journalism from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism. I love soccer. I've played and watched soccer since I was three years old and have never looked back since.

  I started my Sports Journalism journey when I tore my ACL in 8th grade. I couldn't imagine life without sports so I asked to help my local High School soccer team. After picking up cones in practice I worked my way into writing articles and producing video content for three years, including a successful state championship run in 2016. A run where my articles created an excited fan base that slowly started to believe in the team's chances at winning it all.

  ### My Reporting Philosophy

  My design philosophy is rooted in **empathy** and **problem-solving**. I believe great design starts with understanding the 'why' – the user's needs, motivations, and pain points. I use research, iterative prototyping (often with tools like Figma), and user testing to ensure the solutions I build are truly effective.

  I strive to create interfaces that feel effortless, where functionality and beauty work hand-in-hand. Whether I'm crafting pixel-perfect UIs or writing clean Vue.js/Nuxt.js code, my focus is always on creating value for the end-user.

  ### What Drives Me

  What keeps me excited about this work is the constant learning and the challenge of translating complex ideas into simple, elegant solutions. There's nothing more rewarding than seeing a design come to life and knowing it's making someone's digital interaction easier or more enjoyable.

  ### Beyond the Screen

  When I'm not designing or coding, you might find me exploring Boston's latest coffee shops, hiking nearby trails, or occasionally contributing to open-source projects.
